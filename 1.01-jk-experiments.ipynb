    "# Operations Research - Case Study on Hospital Emergency Department System\n",
    "*Given the following, model/simulate the ED system (Discrete Event Simulation with SimPy) to evaluate operational system \"performance\":*\n",
    "- The existing system is struggling with its volume of patients. \n",
    "- The predicted increase in volume is going to push the existing system past its breaking point. \n",
    "- Discuss how simulation (with SimPy) can be used to **(1) evaluate the system performance** and **(2) design the appropriate system capacity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate the performance of ED via the following criteria: \n",
    "1. Average total wait time for each patient with current resources/system capacity\n",
    "2. Average wait time for \"fast-track\" patients - To measure efficiency for quick discharge\n",
    "3. Average wait time for \"serious\" patients whom are discharged\n",
    "4. Average wait time for \"serious\" patients whom are transferred. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "- Doctors are in charge of diagnosis and nurses performing lab-test + preparing medications\n",
    "- Fast-track team only has 1 doctor and 1 nurse\n",
    "- Main ED team has 5 doctors and 5 nurses\n",
    "- Patients no need to wait for doctors if they are available (after collecting their queue numbers)\n",
    "- Patients will definitely need to collect medications before being discharged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Brainstorming (Simplest):** \n",
    "*How does the process run in real-life? Think of steps a patient would have to go through in an ED visit.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Entity - Patient, Resources - Doctors and Nurses*\n",
    "- Arrive at ED, get a queue no. 50% chance of either (1) Fast-track or (2) Main ED\n",
    "1. Fast-Track Patient\n",
    "    - [Fast Track] See doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Determine no. of lab-tests\n",
    "    - [Fast Track] If lab-test, wait for lab-test -> Queue for diagnosis -> Discharge\n",
    "    - [Fast Track] If healthy, Discharge. \n",
    "2. Main ED Patient\n",
    "    - ...\n",
